;; An example combining lazy sequences with higher order functions
;; Generate prime numbers using trial division.
;; Note that the starting set of sieved numbers should be
;; the set of integers starting with 2 i.e., (iterate inc 2) 
;; 
;; Wow that is quite clever how this works!
;; The magic is all happening with the filter that filters out all items divisible 
;; by the first item on the list remembering the the list has previously been filtered
;; by the items before 2, 3, 5 etc
;; How it is working behind the scene is still quite complicated though with multiple
;; lazy evaluation being applied at multiple steps.
