    "## About Notebook\n",
    "This is my notebook for experimenting with Erlang.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was trying to use the official [ierlang iPython kernel](https://github.com/robbielynch/ierlang) but am not able to get this running on my MacBook Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead I am using magic cell commands in a standard IPython notebook. These allow you to run code and commands other than just python code in cells. Here's a list of the magic cell commands that I am using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* %autosave 30 - autosave the notebook every 30 seconds\n",
    "* %cd &lt;testDir&gt; - Change the current directory\n",
    "    * NOTE: Above two are not strictly speaking magic cell commands (these begin with %%)\n",
    "        * Difference is that a magic cell command will use the content of the cell as input for the command \n",
    "* %load &lt;filename&gt; - Loads the content of the file into the cell\n",
    "    * No need for this but I thought I'd mention it just in case I do need it.\n",
    "* %%writefile &lt;filename&gt;\n",
    "    * This is our first true magic cell command and it really is magic!\n",
    "    * When executed (using shift+RETURN) it will write the value of the cell (after the %%writefile line) as the contents of the file.\n",
    "    * This therefore gives us the basic mechanism for creating Erlang files from the cells of the Notebook\n",
    "* %%script erl - Start the Erlang Run Time System\n",
    "    * From within this cell we can then apply Erlang command:\n",
    "        * c(&lt;module&gt;).  - To compile a file\n",
    "        * &lt;module&gt;:main(). - to run the contents\n",
    "    * Output appears as output of the cell\n",
    "    \n",
    "The above are all we need to be able to run and test Erlang concepts from a standard IPython Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of this approach are:\n",
    "* There is no history across cells\n",
    "    * Not sure how the ierlang kernel would have improved this though because Erlang works off files\n",
    "* I need 2 cells for each test\n",
